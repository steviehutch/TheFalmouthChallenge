AppJam app implemented in Javascript and using mySql and php instead of Xamarin
This code forms the basis of the AppJam app created during a Falmouth University app jam, but instead of being written in Xamarin and using Azure, i have
used javascript, html5, php and a mySQL database.
There is much more work to do, but the basic mechanism of adding and viewing geo-location data markers is complete.
